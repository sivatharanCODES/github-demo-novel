Chapter 2 – The Forgotten Past

The dawn in Polikandy came softly, with the cry of roosters echoing across the fields and the first rays of sunlight slipping through the coconut palms. The village began to stir—men walked toward their paddy lands, women balanced pots on their hips as they made their way to the well, and children chased each other barefoot down the dusty lanes.

Amid this rhythm of daily life, the old man sat alone beneath the great banyan tree near the edge of the village. His name was still spoken with respect, but now it was spoken in whispers. Some villagers greeted him politely, others avoided his gaze. Few remembered the man he once was.

“He was a teacher, long ago,” said a shopkeeper to a customer, lowering his voice. “Children used to gather around him every evening. He was strict but kind.”

“Then why does he look so… broken now?” the other asked.

The shopkeeper shrugged. “Something happened. A long time back. No one speaks of it.”

The old man, Thavamani, heard none of this. His eyes were fixed on the ground, but his mind wandered far away, back to another time.

He saw flashes of a younger self—his back straight, his voice strong, chalk dust on his hands as he stood before a blackboard. Children’s voices filled the air, laughter mixed with the recitation of lessons. And then—another image came. A face, smiling. A boy, perhaps his student, perhaps more. The memory was warm, but it did not last.

Darkness crept in. The laughter faded, replaced by screams. The boy’s face blurred into shadow. Thavamani’s chest tightened as if a hand were squeezing his heart. He pressed his palms to his temples, whispering, “Not now… not again…”

A group of children ran past the banyan tree, chasing a worn-out ball. One of them laughed in a way that made him freeze. The sound carried him back decades, to the very same laughter he thought he would never hear again. His breath caught, and for a moment, he felt as though the past itself was mocking him.

Slowly, with trembling fingers, he reached inside his shawl. From a small cloth pouch, he pulled out a folded piece of paper—old, creased, and yellow with age. He did not open it. He never opened it. He only stared at it as though it were alive, as though the words inside carried enough weight to break him all over again.

“It cannot stay buried forever…” he muttered under his breath, his voice barely more than a rasp.

A cool breeze swept through the village, stirring the leaves of the banyan tree. To everyone else, it was just another morning in Polikandy. But for Thavamani, the past was waking, and with it, the worry that had never left him.
