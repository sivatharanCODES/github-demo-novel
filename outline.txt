I'm Starting to write my novel from here..

Onece up on a time a oldman who living in small village called Polikandy started walking through the street. he look worried about something.

Act 1 – The Setup

Introduction of Polikandy – Describe the small, quiet village, its people, and its traditions.

The Old Man Appears – He walks the streets, looking deeply worried. Villagers whisper, but no one knows why.

Hints of the Past – We learn he once played an important role in the village (teacher, healer, or leader). Something changed him.

The First Sign – Strange event or object reminds him of his past (a letter, an old photograph, a broken amulet, etc.).

Act 2 – The Mystery Deepens

The Child Companion – A curious child notices his sadness and starts asking questions.

Village Suspicion – Some people think the old man is hiding something dangerous. Rumors spread.

Fragments of Truth – Through small conversations or memories, pieces of his backstory emerge: he lost someone, made a mistake, or kept a secret from the whole village.

The Discovery – The child (or another villager) uncovers an important clue about the old man’s secret.

Act 3 – Revelation & Resolution

The Confrontation – The old man is forced to face the truth he has avoided. Villagers demand answers, or fate puts him in a position where he must act.

The Truth Revealed – His worry is explained: maybe a tragedy he caused, a promise he broke, or a danger returning to the village.

The Choice – He must decide whether to run from the past again or face it bravely.

The Ending – Either:

Redemption ending: He finds peace, forgives himself, or saves the village.

Tragic ending: His secret destroys him, but the village learns a lesson.


Chapter 2 – The Forgotten Past (Outline)

1. Morning in Polikandy

The next day begins in the village. Daily life is described: farmers in the fields, children running to school, women drawing water.

The old man is seen sitting quietly under the banyan tree or outside his house, lost in thought.

2. Villagers’ Perspective

People whisper about him. Some pity him, others avoid him.

A rumor is shared: years ago, he was not always like this. He once held respect—maybe a teacher, healer, or leader.

3. Glimpses of Memory

The old man has a moment of reflection:

He remembers a younger version of himself.

A scene of happiness (family, students, friends).

But the memory suddenly darkens—something went wrong.

He shakes it off, clearly troubled, but the reader now knows he carries a painful secret.

4. A Small Trigger

Something in the present reminds him of the past:

A child’s laughter echoes like someone he once knew.

A broken house or landmark from years ago..

An old photograph, letter, or object he has kept hidden.

5. Hint of the conflict

He whispers to himself, “It cannot stay buried forever…” or some line that shows his fear of the past returning.

Leaves the reader curious about what happened long ago in Polikandy.
