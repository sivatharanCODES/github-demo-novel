Chapter 1 – The Old Man’s Worry

The village of Polikandy lay quiet under the soft glow of the setting sun. Narrow lanes twisted between small clay houses, their thatched roofs heavy with the dust of many seasons. Children had long gone home, their laughter fading into silence. Even the stray dogs had curled themselves into the shadows, leaving the streets strangely empty.
Through this silence walked an old man. His name was Thavamani, though most villagers simply called him Appa out of respect. His back was bent with age, his beard silver, and his steps were slow but steady. Yet, what caught the eyes of the few who noticed him that evening was not his age but his expression. His brow was furrowed, and his dark, weary eyes carried the weight of something unseen.
He paused now and then, as though listening to whispers no one else could hear. Sometimes his gaze drifted to the old banyan tree at the far end of the road, sometimes to the abandoned well near the temple, and sometimes to the horizon itself, where the last streaks of daylight melted into night.
“Why does Appa look so troubled?” murmured a woman drawing water from the well. Another replied, “He has been like this for weeks. Perhaps he is remembering the war… or perhaps he has seen something he cannot speak of.”
Thavamani did not hear their whispers—or perhaps he chose not to. His mind was elsewhere, circling the same thoughts again and again. Thoughts of a past he had buried for decades, a past he hoped no one would ever uncover. But lately, something had stirred. Old memories returned like restless spirits, refusing to be silenced.
He tightened the shawl around his shoulders and kept walking, his sandals scraping against the rough ground. The night air grew cooler, and the first stars blinked awake in the sky. To anyone else, it was just another evening in Polikandy. But for the old man, every step forward felt heavier, as if fate itself was leading him toward something inevitable.
And though no one else could see it, a shadow seemed to follow him that night.
