Chapter 3 – A Strange Sign

Night settled over Polikandy like a heavy blanket, the stars glimmering faintly above the fields. The village, usually alive with evening chatter, seemed unusually quiet. Only the sound of crickets and the occasional bark of a stray dog broke the stillness.

Thavamani walked slowly back toward his small, crumbling house at the edge of the village. He pushed the wooden door open, the hinges groaning in protest, and stepped inside. The room was bare—just a mat, a clay lamp, and a shelf with a few books so old their spines had nearly vanished.

He lit the lamp and sat cross-legged on the mat. For a long time, he stared at the folded paper he had carried earlier, turning it in his hands but never daring to open it. His eyes, heavy with exhaustion, began to close.

And then—he heard it.

A faint knock. Three times.

Thavamani froze. No one visited him at this hour. For years, people kept their distance, leaving him to his solitude. Slowly, he rose and stepped toward the door, his heart pounding harder with each step.

He opened it.

The street outside was empty. Only the wind whispered through the trees.

He frowned and stepped back inside, but something caught his eye—a faint flicker of light at the far end of the lane. It came from the abandoned house near the old well, a place the villagers avoided after dusk. Some said it was haunted; others said it carried bad memories from the war.

The light glowed for a moment, then disappeared.

Thavamani’s breath quickened. His hands trembled as he closed the door and bolted it shut. He leaned against the wall, whispering to himself, “It has begun…”

That night, sleep did not come. He sat awake until dawn, staring at the folded paper, while outside, the abandoned house waited in silence, holding its secrets.
